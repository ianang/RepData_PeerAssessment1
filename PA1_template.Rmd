## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
unzip("./activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r 1.Calculate the total number of steps taken per day, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
activity_filtered <- filter(activity, !is.na(steps))
activity_grouped <- group_by(activity_filtered, date)
activity_summary <- summarize(activity_grouped, total_steps=sum(steps))
```

```{r 2.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day}
hist(activity_summary$total_steps)
```

```{r 3.Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day}
mean(activity_summary$total_steps)
median(activity_summary$total_steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
